# Meshing The High-Dimensional Spaces for Data Analysis and Visualization

![](./images/regular_simplex_subdivision.svg)

Hypermesh is a header-only library that meshes high-dimensional spaces for data analysis and visualization, such as feature extraction and tracking, flow map computation, and topology analysis. 

## Supported Mesh Types

* Regular grid mesh that consists of *n*-cubes in arbitrary dimensions
* Simplicial subdivision of regular grid mesh that consists of *n*-simplices in arbitrary dimensions
* Extrusion of unstructured 2D/3D mesh to one dimension higher
